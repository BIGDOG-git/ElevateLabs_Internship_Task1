# 🔍 Nmap Network Scan and Wireshark Packet Analysis

This project demonstrates a basic internal network scan using **Nmap** and optional packet-level inspection using **Wireshark**. The goal is to identify active hosts, open ports, and potential vulnerabilities within a local subnet (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).

---

## 🧪 Objectives

- Perform a TCP SYN scan to find open ports on devices in a local network.
- Identify common services and assess potential risks.
- Optionally analyze traffic using Wireshark.
- Save scan results for reporting and further analysis.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Nmap** – Network discovery and port scanning tool.
- **Wireshark** – Packet analyzer for network protocol inspection.
- **Operating System** – Windows/Linux (tested on both).
